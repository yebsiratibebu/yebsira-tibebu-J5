Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) consist of many components with shared structures but unique behaviors. Using inheritance allows these components to reuse common code while easily customizing specific actions. This makes OOP highly effective for building and managing GUIs efficiently.

WindowListener is an interface that defines methods for window events like opening or closing. WindowAdapter is an abstract class that implements WindowListener and a few other window-related interfaces, combining them into one. Instead of implementing every method separately, you can extend WindowAdapter to simplify handling window behaviors. Essentially, WindowAdapter groups all interactions a window can have, making it easier to define an object as a window based on how it interacts rather than what it is.
